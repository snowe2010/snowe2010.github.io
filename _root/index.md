## My Life

I was born in Texas. I grew up in Waco. I now live in Colorado, where I'm a student at the Colorado School of Mines. I currently work for Recondo Technology located in Greenwood Village, CO, where my job is Software Testing. 

I have a lovely girlfriend named Sabrina, and I have a cat named Athena. I like to snowboard, slackline, teach others, and most of all Ruby. I'm currently taking several courses on edX, Coursera, and Udacity while taking classes here at CSM. 

I've got a ton of things I've worked on and even though a lot of them are private you can still view the remaining ones at my github profile. [@snowe2010](http://github.com/snowe2010)

This site is mirrored at snowe2010.github.io and ajourneyinerrors.nfshost.com for the time being. I'll get around to a redirect at somepoint.
