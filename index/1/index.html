<h2 id="toc_0">My Life</h2>

<p>I was born in Texas. I grew up in Waco. I now live in Colorado, where I'm a student at the Colorado School of Mines. I currently work for Recondo Technology located in Greenwood Village, CO, where my job is Software Testing. </p>

<p>I have a lovely girlfriend named Sabrina, and I have a cat named Athena. I like to snowboard, slackline, teach others, and most of all Ruby. I'm currently taking several courses on edX, Coursera, and Udacity while taking classes here at CSM. </p>

<p>I've got a ton of things I've worked on and even though a lot of them are private you can still view the remaining ones at my github profile. @snowe2010</p>

<p>You can also see some of the problems I've encountered over at ajourneyinerrors.nfshost.com if you're interested. I have a hard time keeping it updated though, probably because I suck at css so it discourages me from actually writing anything that would get people to actually visit my page. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd far rather be happy than right any day.&rdquo; </p>

<p>I started the tutorials section by trying to write a post about how to get Ruhoh up and running nice and quick. I used code sections to make things easier, and for that I had to find a good syntax highlighter. I didn't like the way that Google's PrettyPrint worked and I couldn't get SyntaxHighlighter to work (which I later discovered was just because I didn't understand javascript very well) so I went through a ton of different syntax highlighters until I finally learned enough JS from those that I realized I was an idiot when trying to use SyntaxHighlighter.</p>

<p>As a result of all this, I've learned very well how to use Chrome's javascript debugging and breakpoints. The better lesson is, I learned that syntax highlighting is more difficult than it looks :| I'll try to cover some of these difficulties below.</p>

<p>It started when I began to try and make SyntaxHighlighter highlight more things (for Ruby it doesn't highlight the method name or the parameters). I thought this would be easy, because in the brushes you can just define a regex to highlight what you want. Yay, so all I need to do is check for def followed by a name up to a space or a parens. This can be done with something along the lines of this regex:</p>

<pre><code>/(?&lt;=def\s)(\w+\b)\??/g
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially all this does is find the word following def. </p>

<p>Nope. Not that easy. Javascript doesn't support positive or negative lookbehind. Hmm what can I do? Ok I can write a regex to just not capture the def! That can be done like this</p>

<pre><code>/(?:def\s)(\w+\b)\??/g
</code></pre>

<p>Nope. No it can't because even though javascript won't capture that group, it will still match the whole thing :|, while returning a second match of just the captured group. This would work fine if I could somehow figure out how to return just the second match. Well here's the code, maybe you can see the problem.</p>

<pre><code class="brush:js">function getMatches(code, regexInfo)
{
  function defaultAdd(match, regexInfo)
  {
    return match[0];
  };

  var index = 0,
    match = null,
    matches = [],
    func = regexInfo.func ? regexInfo.func : defaultAdd
    pos = 0
    ;

  while((match = XRegExp.exec(code, regexInfo.regex, pos)) != null)
  {
    var resultMatch = func(match, regexInfo);

    if (typeof(resultMatch) == 'string')
      resultMatch = [new sh.Match(resultMatch, match.index, regexInfo.css)];

    matches = matches.concat(resultMatch);
    pos = match.index + match[0].length;
  }

  return matches;
};
</code></pre>
