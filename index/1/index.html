<h2 id="toc_0">My Life</h2>

<p>I was born in Texas. I grew up in Waco. I now live in Colorado, where I'm a student at the Colorado School of Mines. I currently work for Recondo Technology located in Greenwood Village, CO, where my job is Software Testing. </p>

<p>I have a lovely girlfriend named Sabrina, and I have a cat named Athena. I like to snowboard, slackline, teach others, and most of all Ruby. I'm currently taking several courses on edX, Coursera, and Udacity while taking classes here at CSM. </p>

<p>I've got a ton of things I've worked on and even though a lot of them are private you can still view the remaining ones at my github profile. @snowe2010</p>

<p>You can also see some of the problems I've encountered over at ajourneyinerrors.nfshost.com if you're interested. I have a hard time keeping it updated though, probably because I suck at css so it discourages me from actually writing anything that would get people to actually visit my page. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd far rather be happy than right any day.&rdquo; </p>

<p>I started the tutorials section by trying to write a post about how to get Ruhoh up and running nice and quick. 
I used code sections to make things easier, and for that I had to find a good syntax highlighter. 
I didn't like the way that Google's PrettyPrint worked and I couldn't get SyntaxHighlighter to work 
(which I later discovered was just because I didn't understand javascript very well) so I went through 
a ton of different syntax highlighters until I finally learned enough JS from those that I realized 
I was an idiot when trying to use SyntaxHighlighter.</p>

<p>As a result of all this, I've learned very well how to use Chrome's javascript debugging and breakpoints. 
The better lesson is, I learned that syntax highlighting is more difficult than it looks :| 
I'll try to cover some of these difficulties below.</p>
