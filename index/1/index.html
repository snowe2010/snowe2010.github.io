<h3 id="toc_0">Ruhoh, a better Jekyll</h3>

<p>I've begun a move over to the Ruhoh platform. One of the main reasons for this is because I absolutely hate the Liquid Templating system used by Jekyll. 
Ruhoh uses Moustache which seems to be a much nicer choice overall. Also Ruhoh separates everything nice and neat like. </p>

<ul>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>So I don't need to worry about my presentation until I've actually gotten content. 
Another great this is that handling folders and links is a thousand times easier in Ruhoh. </p>

<p>Hopefully this platform goes better than Jekyll. If not I don't know what I'll do.</p>

<h2 id="toc_0">My Life</h2>

<p>I was born in Texas. I grew up in Waco. I now live in Colorado, where I'm a student at the Colorado School of Mines. I currently work for Recondo Technology located in Greenwood Village, CO, where my job is Software Testing. </p>

<p>I have a lovely girlfriend named Sabrina, and I have a cat named Athena. I like to snowboard, slackline, teach others, and most of all Ruby. I'm currently taking several courses on edX, Coursera, and Udacity while taking classes here at CSM. </p>

<p>I've got a ton of things I've worked on and even though a lot of them are private you can still view the remaining ones at my github profile. @snowe2010</p>

<p>You can also see some of the problems I've encountered over at ajourneyinerrors.nfshost.com if you're interested. I have a hard time keeping it updated though, probably because I suck at css so it discourages me from actually writing anything that would get people to actually visit my page. </p>

<p>&ldquo;I'd far rather be happy than right any day.&rdquo; </p>
