My dotfiles are available [here](https://github.com/snowe2010/dotfiles)

-------

My work computer is a MacBook Pro 2018 15in 2.6GHz with 32 GB of RAM

--------

My home computer is a custom built PC running Windows 10 with an Intel Core i7-4790 @ 3.6GHz and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 and 24GB of RAM

--------

I deploy my Mac setup using my dotfiles, listed above. A single command `bin/dot` gets a new computer up and running in about 20 minutes. 
Then I spend about 2 hours signing in and restoring licenses for all the installed software XD.
