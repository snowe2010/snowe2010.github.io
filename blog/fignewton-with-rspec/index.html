          <p>I use Watir-webdriver, PageObject, and several other gems (at the instruction of Jeff &quot;Cheezy&quot; Morgan), for my job. Currently I&#39;ve been writing tests to perform some functions that business people have no care or need to know about. Because there is no need to have business rules for these tests, I&#39;m using RSpec instead of Cucumber. I have Cucumber tests to run all of the business rules that the BA&#39;s need to know about and RSpec tests for those side scripts or non-business side of things. I&#39;ve also read up extensively on Jeff&#39;s Cucumber &amp; Cheese book, though I had forgotten several key points. </p>

<p>For these tests I was trying to load Default Data for different environments, and therefore I was using Jeff&#39;s FigNewton gem. FigNewton allows the use of different configuration files based on the environment the script is being run from. For this you need to place require &#39;fig<em>newton&#39; in the correct place and also call FigNewton.load(&#39;local.yml&#39;) with whatever file you want to load. If you don&#39;t want to use a specific file you can leave out the line and it will first look for an ENV variable called FIG</em>NEWTON_FILE, then if that is not found it will look for a file named after the hostname of the computer, and then finally if even that is not found it will look for a file called &#39;default.yml&#39;. </p>

<p>I was getting errors telling me that it could not find the &#39;default.yml&#39; file even though I had specified the correct file in the env.rb.</p>

<ol>
<li>There is a spec_helper.rb file for RSpec that does the same job as the env.rb file for Cucumber. For some reason I believed that RSpec was using the env.rb file, which caused a lot of problems. </li>
<li>I am also using a gem specified by Jeff called require_all. This gem requires all files in a directory you specify, and it was in the line directly above my FigNewton call. This was causing the FigNewton line to never get called. I&#39;m fuzzy on the details right now about why, so I&#39;ll update this post at a later time when I&#39;ve figured it out.<br></li>
</ol>

<p>After moving the line &quot;FigNewton.load(&#39;local.yml&#39;)&quot; above the &quot;require<em>all &#39;lib&#39;&quot; line, and also placing it in the spec</em>helper.rb file, I was finally able to use default data. </p>
