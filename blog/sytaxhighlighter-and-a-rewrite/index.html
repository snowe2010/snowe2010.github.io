      <section>
        <div id='content'>
          <p>I started the tutorials section by trying to write a post about how to get Ruhoh up and running nice and quick. 
I used code sections to make things easier, and for that I had to find a good syntax highlighter. 
I didn&#39;t like the way that Google&#39;s PrettyPrint worked and I couldn&#39;t get SyntaxHighlighter to work 
(which I later discovered was just because I didn&#39;t understand javascript very well) so I went through 
a ton of different syntax highlighters until I finally learned enough JS from those that I realized 
I was an idiot when trying to use SyntaxHighlighter.</p>

<p>As a result of all this, I&#39;ve learned very well how to use Chrome&#39;s javascript debugging and breakpoints. 
The better lesson is, I learned that syntax highlighting is more difficult than it looks :| 
I&#39;ll try to cover some of these difficulties below.</p>

<p>It started when I began to try and make SyntaxHighlighter highlight more things 
(for Ruby it doesn&#39;t highlight the method name or the parameters). 
I thought this would be easy, because in the brushes you can just define a regex to highlight what you want. 
Yay, so all I need to do is check for def followed by a name up to a space or a parens. 
This can be done with something along the lines of this regex:</p>

<pre><code>/(?&lt;=def\s)(\w+\b)\??/g
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially all this does is find the word following def. </p>

<p>Nope. Not that easy. Javascript doesn&#39;t support positive or negative lookbehind. 
Hmm what can I do? Ok I can write a regex to just not capture the def! That can be done like this</p>

<pre><code>/(?:def\s)(\w+\b)\??/g
</code></pre>

<p>Nope. No it can&#39;t because even though javascript won&#39;t capture that group, 
it will still match the whole thing :|, while returning a second match of just the captured group. 
This would work fine if I could somehow figure out how to return just the second match. 
Well here&#39;s the code, maybe you can see the problem.</p>

<pre><code class="brush:js">function getMatches(code, regexInfo)
{
  function defaultAdd(match, regexInfo)
  {
    return match[0];
  };

  var index = 0,
    match = null,
    matches = [],
    func = regexInfo.func ? regexInfo.func : defaultAdd
    pos = 0
    ;

  while((match = XRegExp.exec(code, regexInfo.regex, pos)) != null)
  {
    var resultMatch = func(match, regexInfo);

    if (typeof(resultMatch) == &#39;string&#39;)
      resultMatch = [new sh.Match(resultMatch, match.index, regexInfo.css)];

    matches = matches.concat(resultMatch);
    pos = match.index + match[0].length;
  }

  return matches;
};
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we always return the first match, oh but wait, it looks like 
we can give it a function to return a different match! Sweet, let&#39;s do that.</p>

<p>Well this appeared to work for a few seconds, then I noticed that now even 
though stuff was highlighted properly, the word &quot;def&quot; was missing from every 
single definition. It was now replaced by the method name, and then part of 
the method name would repeat for no reason. What was going on. </p>

<p>It turns out that the original writer of the plugin would pull out things 
that matched multiple times, instead of coding it in a way that didn&#39;t require that. 
As it is, I&#39;m stuck and my code blocks aren&#39;t going to look very good for a while. </p>

<p>Shoot. </p>
